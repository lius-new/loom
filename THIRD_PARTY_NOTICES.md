## vt100 terminal parser

`vendor/vt100` contains vt100 0.16.2 by Jesse Luehrs, licensed under MIT
(see `vendor/vt100/LICENSE`). Loom modifies height resizing to preserve terminal
history and exposes the row displacement for selection tracking. Upstream:
https://github.com/doy/vt100-rust.

Official Loom packages may include a managed Git runtime. Git is licensed under
the GNU General Public License version 2. Runtime packages must retain Git's
license, source-offer information, upstream version, download URL, and the
generated `runtime/git/MANIFEST.json` file.

The packaging pipeline treats the runtime as a separate executable component;
Loom invokes it through its command-line interface and does not link Git into
the Loom binary.

## Zed GPUI keymap

The key-context predicate language and binding resolution in
`src/input/context.rs`, `src/input/keymap.rs` and `src/input/dispatcher.rs` are
adapted from the `gpui` crate of Zed (https://github.com/zed-industries/zed,
`crates/gpui/src/keymap*` and `crates/gpui/src/key_dispatch.rs`), Copyright
Zed Industries, Inc., licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. The
adapted code was rewritten for Loom's types; its behavior and test cases follow
the original.

## Tree-sitter and language grammars

Syntax highlighting parses source with Tree-sitter and these grammars. All grammars, including JSON and Markdown,
ship as separate standard WASM or native modules loaded on demand, together with the highlight queries referenced by `assets/language-packs/<id>/tree-sitter.json`.
Optional `PROVENANCE.md` files name the upstream repository, commit,
license and any change (the queries of one JavaScript and TypeScript family are
only concatenated).

## Wasmtime and Cranelift

Tree-sitter's WASM feature embeds Wasmtime and Cranelift 48.0.6/0.135.6 from
https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime. They are licensed under
Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception. The Apache 2.0 text is included in LICENSE-APACHE;
the upstream LLVM exception follows:

--- LLVM Exceptions to the Apache 2.0 License ----

As an exception, if, as a result of your compiling your source code, portions
of this Software are embedded into an Object form of such source code, you
may redistribute such embedded portions in such Object form without complying
with the conditions of Sections 4(a), 4(b) and 4(d) of the License.

In addition, if you combine or link compiled forms of this Software with
software that is licensed under the GPLv2 ("Combined Software") and if a
court of competent jurisdiction determines that the patent provision (Section
3), the indemnity provision (Section 9) or other Section of the License
conflicts with the conditions of the GPLv2, you may retroactively and
prospectively choose to deem waived or otherwise exclude such Section(s) of
the License, but only in their entirety and only with respect to the Combined
Software.

## Language servers

Loom's source and installers contain no language server. Servers are separate
programs that Loom downloads on demand from its own releases, each pinned by
SHA-256 in `assets/lsp-servers/lsp-servers.toml`, and runs as separate processes
that it talks to over the Language Server Protocol; Loom does not link them.

Each pack Loom publishes repackages an upstream release unchanged (or, for Go and
npm servers, builds it from a pinned module or lockfile) and carries the upstream
license texts in its `licenses/` directory and its provenance in `PROVENANCE.md`.
The recipes are in `scripts/lsp-servers/build.toml`.

The npm packs also contain the packages those servers depend on; each keeps its own
license inside `node_modules`, and the lockfile in `scripts/lsp-servers/npm` lists them.

## pulldown-cmark
