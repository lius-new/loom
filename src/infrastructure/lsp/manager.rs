//! Runs the language servers for the open documents.

//! One coordinator thread owns every server instance. The application hands it
//! snapshots of the open documents (cheap: text is shared) and gets back a
//! status list; nothing here runs on the UI thread, and a server that is slow,
//! missing or crashing never delays an edit.
//!
//! The coordinator
//! - decides which instance each document belongs to (see `plan`), reading the
//!   disk for project markers only when a document is new or the settings changed;
//! - starts instances, keeps their documents in step, and stops them when idle;
//! - restarts a crashed server after 1, 2 and 4 seconds, then reports it failed
//!   until the user restarts it;
//! - reports a program that cannot be started as unavailable, once, quietly.
