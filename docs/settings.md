# Settings and key bindings

## Configuration files

User settings (`settings.json`), key bindings (`keymap.json`) and the saved
session (`workspace.json`) live in the user configuration folder:

| Platform | Folder |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Loom` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Loom` |
| Linux | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/loom`, or `~/.config/loom` |

On Windows, all persistent user data uses `%APPDATA%\Loom` (Roaming), including
downloaded language resources under `language-packs\.managed`. Loom does not split
user data between the Roaming and Local AppData folders.

A workspace folder can override settings in `.loom/settings.json`; the
`workspace::OpenProjectSettingsFile` action creates and opens it. Appearance
preferences, such as the theme and the interface scale, can only be set in the
user `settings.json`.

## Interface size

Settings → Appearance → **Interface scale** resizes the entire app, including
tabs, sidebars, menus, icons and controls. Use **−** / **+** to choose 80%–200%
in 10 percentage point steps, relative to the operating system's display scale.
**Reset** restores automatic scaling. Changes apply immediately and persist
across restarts. Editor and terminal font sizes can still be adjusted separately.

**Ctrl + +** (or **Ctrl + =**) and **Ctrl + −** adjust the terminal font size
while the terminal has focus, and the editor font size otherwise. **Ctrl + 0**
resets that font's size. On macOS, use Command instead of Ctrl.

The same setting is available in the user `settings.json` as `"ui_scale": 120`.
Remove it or set it to `null` to restore automatic scaling. Like other appearance
preferences, it cannot be overridden by project settings.

## File associations

Loom picks a file's language from the file itself: its name and extension. To
treat other files as a language, add ordered rules to `settings.json` (or to a
workspace folder's `.loom/settings.json`):

```jsonc
"file_associations": [
  { "pattern": "**/*.custom", "language": "rust" },
  { "pattern": "scripts/*.tool", "language": "javascript" }
]
```

`language` is a language name or alias such as `rust`, `csharp`, `javascript`
or `typescript`. Rules are tried in order and the first match wins. A project's
rules apply to files in that folder and come before your own, and both come
before the built-in recognition. Changes apply to open files immediately, and a
rename picks the language for the new name.

Patterns use a small set of wildcards:

- `*` matches any run of characters within one path segment, `?` matches one.
- `**` as a whole segment matches any number of folders, including none.
- A pattern without `/` matches the file name at any depth (`*.custom`).
- A pattern with `/` matches the path below the workspace folder, from its
  start (`docs/**/*.txt`). Files outside every workspace folder only match
  patterns without `/`.
- Case is ignored on Windows and macOS and respected elsewhere.
- `[ ]`, `{ }` and `\` are not supported; a rule using them is skipped.

A rule with an unknown language or an unsupported pattern is skipped and
reported; the other rules still apply.

## Language servers

Loom ships no language servers and does not look for them on your PATH. The
servers it can run are the ones in the catalog published with each release
(`lsp-servers/lsp-servers.toml` beside the application), which describes how to
start each server and which languages it serves, plus servers you register
yourself. A language can have several servers; they all run for a file, and their
diagnostics are shown together. A language that no installed server serves just
has no language-server features.

`language_servers` is an object keyed by server name.

```jsonc
"language_servers": {
  // A catalogued server: change how it behaves, never which program it is.
  "rust-analyzer": {
    "enabled": true,
    "install": "ask",                              // manual | auto
    "args": [],                                    // replaces the default arguments
    "initialization_options": { "checkOnSave": false },
    "settings": { "rust-analyzer": { "check": { "command": "clippy" } } },
    "env": { "RA_LOG": "info" }
  },
  // A server of your own: a full definition. Its `command` must be an absolute
  // path; Loom never searches PATH.
  "my-server": {
    "command": "C:\\tools\\my-server.exe",
    "args": ["--stdio"],
    "languages": [{ "language": "foo", "language_id": "foo" }],
    "root": { "markers": ["foo.toml"], "strategy": "nearest", "fallback": "workspace" },
    "priority": 10
  }
}
```

For a catalogued server only `enabled`, `install`, `args`, `initialization_options`,
`settings`, `env` and `priority` may be given; its `command`, `languages`, `root` and
`display_name` are the catalog's. To run another program, register it under a new
name. An entry with a mistake is reported and skipped; the others still apply.

A server runs once per project folder, found with the project files its definition
names (the nearest or the outermost one), never above the open workspace folder. It
stops a minute after its last file is closed, and a crashed server is restarted
after 1, 2 and 4 seconds before being reported as failed.

Each server instance reports only its own project folder to the server. Opening
several project folders creates separate instances and keeps their document
sessions and results independent.

The language panel shows the server's background tasks. A task marked cancellable
by its server has a **Cancel** button. It stays marked as cancelling until the
server ends it. If cancellation is not acknowledged within five seconds, or a task
reports no progress for five minutes, Loom stops tracking it and records a warning
in the panel log. This does not mean the server finished the work; **Restart
servers** remains available when a server is stuck.

`install` says what Loom does when a file needs a catalogued server whose files are
not on this computer yet. `manual` (the default) installs nothing on its own: the
status bar shows the server with an amber dot, and the language panel lists it with an
**Install** button and the download size, an estimate from the missing catalog
archives that counts shared runtimes once. `auto` downloads and installs right away.
A server you register needs no installation. Downloads are checked against the
catalog's SHA-256 and the server is started once before it is activated.

An installation in the language panel has a **Cancel** button. Cancelling removes
queued work and cleans up partial downloads and staging files; a shared runtime
continues while another installation still needs it. A blocked network call stays
marked as cancelling until it returns or times out (30 seconds for connecting,
60 seconds for a read). **Resume** starts a fresh attempt and reuses complete,
verified archives. Automatic installation respects cancellation for the current
language-service session; it does not resume a cancelled request on its own.

`settings` is what the server gets when it asks for its configuration
(`workspace/configuration`). Changing it tells the running server; it is not
restarted. Changing `args`, `initialization_options` or `env` starts a new instance.

### Languages

```jsonc
"languages": {
  "typescript": {
    "language_servers": ["biome", "typescript-language-server", "..."],
    "formatter": "biome",
    "format_on_save": true,
    "code_actions_on_save": ["source.organizeImports", "source.removeUnusedImports"]
  }
}
```

`language_servers` chooses which servers a language uses and in what order (the
first is preferred); `"..."` stands for the servers not named, in their usual
order, and a list without it leaves the others out. `formatter` names the server
that formats (by default the first that can). `format_on_save` and
`code_actions_on_save` run before the file is written. Action kinds run in list
order, with each request using the text left by the preceding action; lazy
actions are resolved and commands finish before formatting. Each server step
has a one second limit, and the complete pipeline has a two second limit before
the file is saved anyway. Saving continues to target the original document if
you switch tabs while waiting. TypeScript Language Server 6 uses separate kinds
for sorting/combining imports and removing unused imports, as in this example.

### Behaviour

```jsonc
"lsp": {
  "hover_delay_ms": 300,             // how long the pointer rests before hover opens
  "completion": {
    "auto": true,                    // open the list while typing; false = only the key
    "accept_on": "enter_and_tab",    // enter_and_tab | enter | tab
    "words_fallback": true           // complete words of the file without a server
  },
  "inlay_hints": false,
  "semantic_highlighting": "combined",   // combined | off
  "max_document_bytes": 8388608          // larger files are not sent to servers
}
```

These settings are only read from your own `settings.json`: a project's
`.loom/settings.json` cannot choose which program Loom runs.

### Keys

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Ctrl+Space | Show completions |
| Ctrl+Space in a choice placeholder | Reopen the snippet's choices |
| Ctrl+Shift+Space | Signature help |
| Alt+Up / Alt+Down | Previous / next overload while signature help offers several |
| Ctrl+K Ctrl+I | Hover |
| F12 / Ctrl+F12 / Ctrl+Shift+F12 / Alt+F12 | Definition / implementation / type definition / declaration |
| Shift+F12 | References |
| F2 | Rename |
| Ctrl+. | Code actions |
| Shift+Alt+F | Format file |
| Ctrl+K Ctrl+F | Format selection |
| F8 / Shift+F8 | Next / previous problem |
| Ctrl+Shift+O / Ctrl+T | Symbols in the file / in the workspace |
| Alt+Left / Alt+Right | Back / forward |
| Shift+Alt+Right / Left | Grow / shrink the selection by syntax |

A lightbulb appears in the gutter when the caret or selection rests for 350 ms
and a language server offers an enabled code action. Click it to open the cached
list, or press Ctrl+. to request actions explicitly. Discovery never applies an
edit. The bulb and its menu expire when the selection, open documents,
diagnostics, or server registrations change. Empty, disabled-only, and failed
automatic results stay quiet; explicit menus retain disabled actions and their
reasons. The bulb has its own lane beside line numbers and Git change marks and
keeps the editor's caret and focus when clicked.

Signature help also offers up/down buttons when the call has several overloads.
Switching updates the parameter highlight and documentation without moving the
caret. The selection is retained while help refreshes, including when the server
reorders its signatures; if it disappears, the server's current choice is used.
The buttons keep focus in the editor, and the completion list's Up/Down keys still
move through completions. Customize these bindings in the `SignatureHelp` context
with `editor::PreviousSignature` and `editor::NextSignature`.

Snippet placeholders can offer a list of values. Up/Down and PageUp/PageDown move
through it; Enter, Tab, or a click chooses a value and updates its mirrors in one
undo step. Tab then moves to the next placeholder, and Shift+Tab goes back.
Escape dismisses the list so you can type your own value; Ctrl+Space reopens it
at the current choice. This uses `editor::ShowSnippetChoices` in the
`SnippetChoice` context. The list keeps focus in the editor and its confirmation
keys are independent of `lsp.completion.accept_on`. Undo/Redo ends the snippet
session; Escape outside the list also ends it.

Snippets can transform variables when inserted and placeholder mirrors when Tab
leaves the current placeholder. For example, `${1:name} ${1/(.*)/${1:/upcase}/}`
turns the second `name` into `NAME` on Tab. Capture references, conditional formats,
and common case conversions are supported. Unknown variable names become editable
placeholders; repeated names share their value. Known variables without an
available value use their default or an empty string. Invalid or over-budget
transforms preserve the input value; regular expression behavior is not fully
compatible with ECMAScript UTF-16 semantics.

In Vim's normal mode: `K` hover, `gd` definition, `gD` declaration, `gy` type
definition, `gi` implementation, `gr` references.

## Key bindings

Shortcuts come from a Zed-style keymap. The **Keymap** page (Ctrl + K Ctrl + S,
or Settings → Keyboard → Open Keymap) opens in its own tab and lists every
action with its bindings; filter it by action, keystroke or context. Its
**Edit keymap.json** button opens your `keymap.json` in the
[configuration folder](#configuration-files). Saved changes apply immediately;
entries with mistakes are reported and skipped.

```jsonc
[
  {
    "context": "Editor",                     // where the bindings apply
    "bindings": {
      "alt-up": "editor::MoveToBeginning",   // keystrokes → action
      "secondary-y": null,                   // null disables a default binding
      "secondary-k secondary-d": ["pane::ActivateItem", 0] // sequences, arguments
    }
  }
]
```

- **Keystrokes** join modifiers with `-`: `ctrl`, `alt`, `shift`, `cmd`, and
  `secondary` (Command on macOS, Ctrl elsewhere). Separate a sequence with spaces.
- **Contexts**: `Workspace` (always), `Editor`, `Terminal`, `Input`, `Menu`,
  `CloseConfirmation`, `CloneRepository`. Combine them with `&&`, `||`, `!` and
  `>` (ancestor), and test attributes such as `extension == rs` or `os == windows`.
- **Precedence**: a binding in a more specific context wins (Editor over
  Workspace); within one context, later bindings — yours — win.

The default bindings are in [`assets/keymaps/default.json`](../assets/keymaps/default.json).
`LOOM_LOG_KEYS=1` in a debug build prints how each keystroke resolved.
