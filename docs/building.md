# Building Loom

## Toolchain

Install Node.js 20+ (CI selects Node 24), Rust and the platform C/C++ SDK.
Rust 1.97.1, Clippy and rustfmt are pinned in
[`rust-toolchain.toml`](../rust-toolchain.toml); CI uses the same compiler.
Windows needs Visual Studio C++ Build Tools and the Windows SDK; macOS needs
Xcode Command Line Tools. Linux system libraries are listed below.

Use the shared build entry point:

```sh
node scripts/build/cargo.mjs build --release --locked
node scripts/build/stage-resources.mjs target/release
node scripts/build/cargo.mjs run --release --locked
node scripts/build/cargo.mjs test --locked --workspace
```

[`scripts/dependencies`](../scripts/dependencies/README.md) automatically downloads
pinned CMake and the matching prebuilt Skia archive, verifies SHA-256 and prepares
only the Cargo child environment. No system CMake, manual Skia download, LLVM
installation or global PATH change is required. `lgui` renders with the software
Skia backend (`renderer-skia-software`) and presents through `softbuffer`.
The managed inputs cover Windows x64, Linux x64 and macOS arm64/x64. CMake is
chosen by host OS/architecture; Skia is chosen by Rust target and resolved features.

To prime the private cache before an offline build:

```sh
node scripts/dependencies/ensure.mjs
node scripts/build/cargo.mjs build --release --locked --offline
```

Cargo crates/toolchains must also be cached for offline use. Bare `cargo` bypasses
the dependency preparer; use the Node entry point for full application builds.
GUI-free core/domain tests and formatting do not prepare these dependencies.
Installed Loom users need none of these build tools.

The framework dependency uses a fixed Git revision in `Cargo.toml` and
`Cargo.lock`; no sibling lgui checkout is required. To update the framework,
change its `rev` in `Cargo.toml` and run `cargo update -p lgui` to refresh the lock
file before validating the build.

The host build and default tests require no language resources or grammar sources.
Loom includes the generic Tree-sitter engine and dynamically loads compatible
standard WASM or native language modules when used. WASM does not require
a platform-specific language library. There is no language producer workspace or
Rust grammar wrapper. Place complete prebuilt language resources beside the
executable or in the user data directory and restart; no editor rebuild is
needed. See [Language resources](languages.md) for the format and release inputs.

For `cargo run` or the shared wrapper's debug run, prepare resources with:

```sh
node scripts/build/stage-resources.mjs
node scripts/build/cargo.mjs run --locked
```

The staging command defaults to `target/debug`. Pass `target/release` for a release
run, or the executable's directory for custom Cargo targets/profiles. It copies
both runtime resource sets: syntax collections and their download catalog, plus
the LSP server catalog. It does not install language servers or download grammars.
Without the syntax catalog a new language can appear as TXT; without the LSP
catalog no catalogued server is registered. A temporary syntax download status
then disappears when complete, leaving no server status to replace it. Restart
the application after staging or updating catalogs; both are read at startup.

## System dependencies (Debian / Ubuntu)

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential \
    libfreetype-dev libfontconfig-dev \
    libegl1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libgles2-mesa-dev \
    libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev fonts-noto-cjk fonts-noto-color-emoji
```

A running X11 or Wayland desktop session is required to open the window.
(On WSL2, enable WSLg and install the packages above inside the distro.)

## Tests

The framework-independent editing core lives in
[`crates/editor-core`](../crates/editor-core/README.md). Run its tests without the
GUI with `cargo test --locked -p loom-editor-core`; run all application and core
regressions with `node scripts/build/cargo.mjs test --locked --workspace`. Workspace domain rules also
have a GUI-free verification entry point: `cargo test --locked -p loom-workspace-tests`.

`node scripts/architecture/check.mjs` enforces the module boundaries that CI
checks.

## Continuous integration and releases

Daily CI checks formatting and architecture, runs independent crate tests once,
and retains all host functional tests on Linux x64, Windows x64 and macOS.
Clippy shares the Linux host environment. Expensive tool/integration/evidence
and preview-package checks run only when selected by Additional validation.
Verified Cargo sources and tool archives are cached; native preparation never
runs test suites. Universal macOS builds belong to release/preview packaging.

The unified release.yml workflow first verifies successful CI for the exact
tagged commit. It then builds/packages each platform once, runs minimal final
artifact checks, and creates/uploads one complete draft after all platforms
succeed. Release does not repeat CI test suites or wait for another workflow
to create a draft. Manual runs default to packaging without draft upload.

See [release tooling](../scripts/release/README.md) and
[CI validation policy](../scripts/ci/README.md) for trigger rules and prerequisites.

Build packages for the current platform locally with:

~~~sh
node scripts/package/package.mjs all
~~~

Release versions come from the application tag. The verified release runner
materializes Cargo.toml/Cargo.lock version fields before compiling; generated
version changes are never committed or pushed. Development builds retain the
source manifest version. A version-only commit is not required.
